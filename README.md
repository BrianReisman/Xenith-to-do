considered saving to local storage the filter/view applied on last visit but think that's a poor UX choice since if the user doesn't realize they might thing they're missing items completed or not yet complete.

Is # items left total items left undone? Or total items left on the list, ie have not yet been cleared.

[] add check if input field is empty.
